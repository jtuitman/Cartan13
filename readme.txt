This is Magma code to carry out the computations from the paper:

Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the Split Cartan Modular Curve of Level 13 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05846)

Large parts of the code (everything which does not involve Frobenius) are based on earlier SAGE code by 
Netan Dogra and Steffen Mueller has also made some contributions.

The code has been written in such a way that it should apply to other curves (satisfying the assumptions
from the paper) without a lot of effort. If you have an interesting example, please send it to me so I can
give it a try.
